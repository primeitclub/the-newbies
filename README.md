GharDera 🏠🇳🇵
GharDera is a mission-driven platform to help students from rural villages across Nepal — especially those coming to Kathmandu after Class 10 (SEE) and Class 12 (+2) — find affordable hostels, rooms, or rental spaces without brokers or hidden fees.

Many people suffer from high brokerage charges, lack of verified listings, and the overwhelming task of navigating a new city. GharDera is built to solve these problems with technology and compassion.
